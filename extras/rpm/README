This is the RPM spec file that can be used to build dcdb for Linux.  It has
been tested on and is known to work on the following Linux distributions:

Mandrake 9.2
Redhat AS 2.1,3.0,4.0

If you get it working on a platform that is not listed above, please feel free
to contribute any changes you had to make and/or let me know.  Basically, you
need to get the sources and put them in WhereeverRPMLikesItsStuff/SOURCES. 
Then, you can copy the dcdb.spec file to WhereeverRPMLikesItsStuff/SPECS. 
Then, do the following:

export CFLAGS="-O3 -s -march=i686 -mcpu=i686"
export PATH=/non-threaded-perl-path:$PATH
cd /WhereeverRPMLikesItsStuff/SPECS
rpmbuild -bb dcdb.spec

The CFLAGS setting is honored by the configure script.  The PATH setting is
needed if your Linux has a threaded perl.  In that case, you can specify in the
path where your non-threaded version of perl is.

The following is a sample of the steps that I take to do this on my Mandrake
box:

export CFLAGS="-O3 -s -march=i686 -mcpu=i686"
cp dcdb.spec /usr/src/RPM/SPECS/
cd /usr/src/RPM/SOURCES/
wget http://w3.tvi.edu/~dmay/dcdb-1.2-X.tar.gz
cd /usr/src/RPM/SPECS/
rpm -bb --target i686 dcdb.spec
cd /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i686
rpm -ivh dcdb-1.2-X.i686.rpm
rpm -ivh dcdb-lib-1.2-X.i686.rpm
rpm -ivh dcdb-extra-1.2-X.i686.rpm
rpm -ivh dcdb-doc-1.2-X.i686.rpm

Where X is the version of DCDB that you are working with.

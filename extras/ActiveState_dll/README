DCDB is a personal database engine designed to be easy to use, light-weight
and fast.  The homepage for DCDB is

This is cdbtcl.dll, a dynamic link library compiled with MinGW and designed to
be loaded by ActiveState tcl/tk.  Essentially, you copy the dll to the bin
directory of the ActiveState distribution on your system,

copy cdbtcl.dll c:\tcl\bin

Then, you load the dll when you want to use it, for example, in a script, as follows:

if [catch {load c:/tcl/bin/cdbtcl.dll} result] {
  puts "Couldn't load c:/tcl/bin/cdbtcl.dll: $result"
  exit 1
}

Then, you can use the commands documented in cdb.pdf under the tcl binding
section.  There are some of the commands listed there that are not included
in this DLL and they are as follows:

md5sum
sha1sum
rmd160sum
dbtime
dbtest* (all the dbtest bindings).
dbencrypt
dbdecrypt

If you need any of the functionality above, you can download the entire
distribution at

http://w3.tvi.edu/~dmay/dcdb-1.2-18.tar.gz

and compile it for cygwin.

You can build the DLL yourself, if you want to.  You will need cygwin (including
the development system: gcc, make, tcl/tk, swig, openssh - and latex, if you want to
build docs).  Then, you will need MinGW+MSYS.  When you have them installed and
you can execute the msys shell environment, you should have enough to build
cdbtcl.dll.

Unpack dcdb-1.2-18.tar.gz into a directory on your C drive (or some other local
drive - do not use a DFS drive unless you have lots of time to waste).  Then,
in a cygwin shell, execute the following:

export CFLAGS="-O2 -s -marc=pentium4 -mtune=pentium4 -Wall -W -finline-functions -funroll-loops -fno-strength-reduce -pipe"
./configure

Note that you should use CFLAGS that make sense for your environment.  After
configure is completed, go the the msys shell, cd to the dcdb-1.2/lib directory
and type

sh build_mingw.sh

If that doesn't complete successfully, you probably do not have the tools that
you need.  Make sure you have swig with cygwin and make sure you have the
complete development environment with MinGW+MSYS.  Note also that ActiveState
TCL needs to be installed in c:\Tcl, which is its default location, I believe.

Once you get a successful installation, you can copy or move cdbtcl.dll from
dcdb-1.2/lib to c:\tcl\bin and you are ready to go.

Enjoy!

These are older test programs used to test the core functionality of the
components that make up the DCDB database engine.  Some of these are duplicates
of tests in the (topdir)/tests directory tree, but are older and less
sofisticated.  Most of these, however, are older tests.  These can be used to
make sure that changes made to the C files are still compatible with stuff that
was already there.

Using these is fairly easy.  Basically, follow these steps:

export CFLAGS="-O2 -s -march=pentium4 -mcpu=pentium4 -Wall"
bash makem.sh
bash run_tests.sh
bash clean.sh

The CFLAGS variable should correspond to your system.  Before you execute
run_tests.sh, you may want to edit it and change the COUNT variable to something
smaller or larger - the default is 25.  The last line should clean up and get
you back to where it was before you started.

Enjoy.

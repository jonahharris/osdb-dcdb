- It would be nice to be able to have an application that displays a list of
changes one line at a time.  Then, if you click on the line or hit the space bar
on the line, it will flesh it out with all the information.  Sometimes, the
change report is REALLY big and it is a result of minor things (an update to the
X11 fonts, for example, can produce an absolutely HUGE report).
- It would be nice to be able to query against the change report, like 'show all
changes except those done on 20030708'.  That way, you could eliminate quickly
the changes that were done as a result of an update.
- It would be nice to be able to get a list of files (like that generated by
RPM) and be able to remove the anything from the change file if it was in that
list.  So, when an update is done, you use rpm to generate a list of files in
the update and you eliminate that from the changes list.

All of the above are along the same lines.  Maybe I could do it in one utility.

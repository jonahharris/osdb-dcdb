This is chx.  chx is designed to be a simple checker for changes in files in a
directory or directories.  It is most useful to get a quick assessment of
changes that have occurred in a directory structure over time or in comparing
one directory structure with another.

For example, in our administration we have a primary database system and a
secondary that is configured to be a total replacement should we loose the
primary.  There are critical file systems on the secondary that I sync with
corresponding file systems on the primary so we could come up in production
mode on the secondary quickly.  However, there are a group of programers who
have very little discipline as far as making changes to these file systems in
any kind of controlled way.

I use chx to take snapshots of the file systems and insure that they are kept
in sync.  I compare snapshots of the file system on the primary from one week
to the next (to insure that nothing has changed in an uncontrolled way on this
file system) and I compare snapshots between the primary and the secondary to
insure that they are in sync.  Users know that I will be aware of changes and
will bring them to their attention and so are more concientious about what they
do with these file systems.

I am sure that every system administrator alive has similar accountability needs
with users of elevated privilege.

To use chx, you get snapshots using the chx_get_file_lists.{shl,tcl} scripts. 
The TCL script is probably the most effective means of getting this information,
but requires that you compile DCDB's libcdbtcl.{so,dll} binary for each client. 
The shell script performs the same function, but does so without the need for
the shared object.  To get a snapshot of some directory using the script, type
the following:

./chx_get_file_lists.shl /some/directory >chx_snapshot.20040511

Then, a few days later you can run the same command.  To get a report of changes
between the directories, copy the snapshots to the system where you have DCDB
installed and issue the following commands:

cp ../../../lib/libcdbtcl.so .
./chx chx_shapshot.day1 chx_snapshot.day2

Notice that this assumes that you have followed the instructions for DCDB and
compiled the libcdbtcl.so shared object.  This should give you a report of the
additions, deletions and changes that have occurred on the files in the
directory you are monitoring.

I have also added the chx_solaris_contents TCL script and the
filter_solaris8_contents_file.shl script.  These are designed to help the
administrator who works with Solaris 8.  Basically, they will give you a list of
files that have changed between one patch level and the next.  This is done by
comparing a new contents file to the old one (the contents file is the
/var/sadm/install/contents file).  Consider the following example:

You have 2 files, con.20030818 and con.20040808.  The first is the contents
file after you patched in 20030818 and the second is the contents file after
you patched on 20040808 (if you don't save the contents files, you should).  To
process those 2, you would do the following:

cp ../../../lib/libconttcl.so .
./filter_solaris8_contents_file.shl /tmp/con.20040808 /tmp/con.20030818
./chx_solaris_contents /tmp/con.20040808.output /tmp/con.20030818.output

After this, you will have a file called solaris_contents_diff.txt that contains
the files that were added and changed in the system.  Note that this only
includes files (not directories, etc).  You should make sure to run
chx_solair_contents with the most recent contents file as the first argument and
the second most recent file as the second argument.  It makes assumptions about
the contents that will not be correct if you don't do it this way.

Enjoy.

This file contains some C source files that compare the efficiency of my shell
sort with that of the ANSI C qsort() and a fast qsort(), the source of which
is provided in qsort.c.  These comparisons are mostly of academic interest.  Below is a list of the files here and what they do:

clean.sh - cleans up stuff after it is created.
makem.sh - builds all the test programs in this directory.
flog*.c - C source files testing various components of the shell sort.
flog*.sh - shell drivers that can be used for testing.
word*.c - C source files that create bogus data for sorting.
outstats.{c,sh} - C source and shell driver used to average comparison results
  over thousands of iterations.
sort.{c,h}, qsort.c - Actual sort routines.  These are symbolic links to files
in the lib and include directories.

To build the tests, type

export CFLAGS="-O3 -s -march=pentium4 -mcpu=pentium4 -pipe"
bash makem.sh

You can change the CFLAGS to suite your system.  To clean up stuff, type

bash clean.sh

To run a given test, type, for example,

bash flogshsort.sh

If you want to change the number of items being sorted, you can edit the
shell driver and change it there (the default is 250,000).

Enjoy.

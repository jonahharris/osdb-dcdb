20040211

- I moved 1.1-final to a staging directory.  Then, I consolidated some of the
source and created the 1.2 distribution.
- I set up autoconf and automake scripts for portable building with the help of
Jonah Harris.  Thanks, Jonah.
- I updated the documentation.
- Testing is driven by a Makefile in the tests subdirectory.  I now have TCL
tests written and available.  I will write comparable tests in C and Perl before
the full 2.0 release.

20040217

- I fixed a bug in split() that was a show stopper.

20040302

- I wrote C test functions that mirrored the tcl test functions (except where
it didn't make sense to make a C function like that).
- I configured RCS for the .{h,c,i,tcl,sh} files in the distribution.
- I did some proof-reading of the documentation and cleaned up some glaring
problems.
- I released RC2.

20040309

- I changed the way the TCL and Perl modules were being compiled.  This was due
in part to trying to make configure do what I wanted and eventually getting
frustrated and giving up.
- I enabled the compilation of mycint (the cint bindings) in
(top)/extras/cint.  It has only been tested on Linux and is kludgy - it isn't
done automatically by the configure script.
- I updated RCS for all the stuff that I have finalized till now.

20040310

- I released RC3.

20040311

- I fixed a problem with flograwadd1.c.  DOH!

20040312

- I cleaned up the documentation some more.
- I made some cosmetic changes to files and such and checked them in.
- I edited the README file to accommodate the changes that I made.
- I created a spec file for Mandrake.  I need to test it on RedHat.

20040313

- I released 1.2-1.
- I made some tweaks to the (topdir)/extras/rpm/dcdb.spec file.

20040324

- I fixed a bug in (topdir)/test/c/flograwadd1.c.  In error messages, I was
using table as the table name instead of table->fileName.  That would have
caused a core dump had there been an error.
- I made some minor changes that were brought out by compiling the C test
programs with warning levels turned on high.  DOH!
- I released this as 1.2-2.

20040326

- I made minor performance enhancements (include/index.h).

20040402

- I updated (topdir)/lib/cdb.c and (topdir)/lib/cdbdf.c.  Where supported, I
replaced calls to sprintf to snprintf in code that got its input from the user.
- I did a fairly extensive update of the documentation.
- I released this as 1.2-3.

20040511

- I updated (topdir)/extras/fido/chx.  I added chx_get_file_lists.tcl.  The .shl
was slow and clunky - the tcl script is faster but requires DCDB's libcdbtcl.so
to be installed on the client.  Not a problem in my environment.

20040819

- I released 1.2-4.

20040830

- Fixed a typo in the documentation (shlErrorString->shlErrorStr).

20040907

- I fixed an error in cdbui.c in timeStamp2Date().  Dates would come back like
"200409 4" instead of "20040904".

20040915

- I fixed the broken autoconf shtuff.  Man, autotools is painful.
- I released 1.2-5.

20040916

- I added the containerRestructureIndex command.
- I added chx_solaris_contents and filter_solaris8_contents_file.shl in
(topdir)/extras/fido/chx.

20040917

- I released 1.2-6.

20040923

- I updated (topdir)/extras/fido/fidod/fidod to generate a journal file
(.jnl).  This is a list of the raw data that is gleaned from the client at the
time fido is run.  I can use this data for historical purposes.
- I updated (topdir)/extras/fido/fidod/fido_compare.c to support a -q switch. 
When envoked with -q (quiet mode), fido_compare only prints the new time stamp
and the objects name in the change report.
- I updated (topdir)/extras/fido/fidod/fido_list to print the output in '|'
delimited format instead of ':' delimited.

20041105

- I added support for tcc (TinyCCompiler).  If tcc isn't on the system, 'make'
in (topdir)/tests will biff about it a little, but it is the last test.

20041108

- I altered the Makefile in (topdir)/lib and the cdbtcl.i and cdbpl.i files
so that the container stuff is added to each of them.  I felt it was kind of
silly to have to include the container stuff seperately.  Also, I felt the
container stuff was useful enough in tcl, it may be useful in perl as well.

20041230

- I fixed a nasty bug in the sort algorythm.  Basically, when there were
many duplicates being sorted, the algorythm could GPF or get caught in an
infinite loop.  The sort algorythm breaks down when you have many duplicates
and becomes VERY slow (almost uselessly so).  If you have to sort a data
set that has many duplicates (like, more than half of the items are duplicates
of one or more of the data set), use something else to sort them initially
if you can.  The ironic thing is that the index code sorts duplicates very
well, thank you very much.  Better, in fact, than the in-memory sort.  Go
figure.

20041231

- I finalized the sort algorythm fix.  Performance is up to par and the tests
have run with thousands of data sets without error.
- I am releasing version 1.2-9.


20050120

- I incorporated some old tests in (topdir)/extras/regress_test.  Read the
README in that directory for simple instructions on running the regression tests
if you want.
- I released dcdb-1.2-10.

20050128
- I did a code cleanup so that everything compiles with warnings turned on high
(-Wall -W).  This also sped up the code a tad bit.
- I released dcdb-1.2-11.

20050206
- I removed (topdir)/lib/Makefile.am.  Basically, it was broken and was not
creating libcdb-x.x-xx.so correctly (I never could get the versioning right and
the .so disappeared with a new version of automake - piece of junk!)  I just
hand coded a Makefile.in and that works much better.

20050207
- I fixed the (topdir)/extras/dcdb.spec file so that it builds successfully
under Mandrake and RedHat.  I created some rpms for those distributions.
- I released dcdb-1.2-12.

20050511
- I included the following source files:

  lib/bcnum.c
  lib/number.c
  include/bcnum.h
  include/number.h

The number.{h,c} files are the source files from the arbitrary precision
number engine from GNU bc (bc-1.06).  The copyright and attribution for those are in the
sources.  The difference between this and the original is trivial:

dfmay04:dfmay:~/devl/dcdb-1.2$ diff lib/number.c ~/gnu/bc-1.06/lib/number.c
33c33
< #include <string.h>
---
> #include <config.h>

There is no difference between the included number.h and that from bc.

The bcnum.{c,h} files are wrappers around the number.{h,c} functionality to make
it easier to create bindings for TCL and Perl (although, I haven't tested the
Perl bindings at all).
Note: the tests/c/flognum1.c file doesn't work on solaris.  I will remove this
when I fix it.
- I released dcdb-1.2-13.

20050513
- I added bcnumuninit to the bcnum bindings so the user can uninitialize the
bcnum stuff.  This allows a person to free up the memory used by it, even though
it gets freed up by an atexit() call in cdb.c.

20050520
- I fixed some minor bugs on bcnum bindings in cdb.c.
- I released dcdb-1.2-14.

20050503
- I added the following functions from GNU bc: bc_sub, bc_is_zero,
bc_is_near_zero, bc_is_neg.  I think the functionality from the bc number engine
has been fairly well fleshed out.
- I released dcdb-1.2-15.

20050618
- I rebuilt the fido client to handle some shortcomings when there are lots
of files and lots of excludes.  It was a putrid dog in those cases.  There is
more work to come there.

20050622
- I added the hash functionality to sort.{h,c}.
- I added tests/c/floghash1.{c,sh} and tests/tcc/floghash1_tcc.sh.
- I added tests/c/rough_sort.c

20050624
- I fixed a memory leak in hash stuff and cleaned up the documentation.
- I released dcdb-1.2-16.

20050707
- I changed the way errors are handled in sort.{h,c} to make it a little more
thread safe.
- I fixed a few minor bugs.

20050509
- I wrote tests/c/flogthrd1.{sh,c} to test the threaded sort routines.
- I further changed the list error handling to make it thread safe.  There is
more work to do there, though.
- I released dcdb-1.2-17.

20050729
- I cleaned up some test stuff that was broken.

20050812
- I made a minor change to sort.c that drastically improved searches when the
item being searched for was not there.
- I updated the documenation for the sort stuff.
- I added a second test for the bcnum functionality.
- I released dcdb-1.2-18.

20051212
- I made slight changes, mostly in the fido stuff.   The changes so far don't
merit a new release, so I am going to stay with -18.

20060401
- I reverted back to a simple file lock.  The other locking mechanism isn't
working.  I will have to revisit it.  And, no, this is not an April fool's joke.

20060410
- I edited some stuff on the fido client.

20060515
- I added support for creating a DLL under MinGW that works with ActiveState
TCL.

20060603
- I added support for creating a python module.  Also, I added the first python
test script.  I will add more as time permits.
